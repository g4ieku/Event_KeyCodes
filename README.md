# Key Event Display

A lightweight JavaScript project that shows the details of any key you press on your keyboard.  
It dynamically reveals the `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` properties when a keydown event occurs.

## How It Works
- Press any key on your keyboard.
- The project hides the instruction text and displays a container with key details.
- It shows three values:
  - **e.key** → The actual key pressed (e.g., "A", "Enter", "Space").
  - **e.keyCode** → The numeric key code.
  - **e.code** → The physical key location on the keyboard.

## Example
Pressing the **Spacebar** will display:
- `e.key`: Space
- `e.keyCode`: 32
- `e.code`: Space

## Use Cases
- Learning and debugging keyboard events in JavaScript.
- Building custom keyboard shortcuts.
- Educational demo for beginners.
